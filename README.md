Problem Statement & Applying suitable design pattern

Problem Statement:
Most people in the corporate world or in their academic life, have a major problem of not being able to list and prioritize what tasks do they have, how can they work efficiently to finish all the stuff in time without any stress or procrastination which generally doesn’t happen, all while reducing the overall output of the individual as well as the organizations where the individual is working.
Most of them have tasks to do within a certain deadline and the quantity of these tasks, their deadlines and various other complexities, which might involve a third party dealing or field work, which is necessary, of course, is too much for a human brain to process and store, let alone analysing and prioritizing the work to do.

Proposed Solution
They need a tool on which they can rely on, to remember all their tasks stored in a place, capable of representing themselves whenever asked for just by a touch or a click. A tool which efficiently categorizes the tasks that are done and the ones that are yet to be done, along with the target date for each task. The user can add as many tasks as he or she wants, and delete them when they’re done.
Such a tool can potentially change everyone’s lives who use it. It can surely increase the productivity of the person as well as the organization for which he or she is working for. It is all because of this tool, a person would be able to sit back and work efficiently thanks to this tool, who remembers everything that the person would ever want to do.
And that is the proposed solution for the problem statement given above.
